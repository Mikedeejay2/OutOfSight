# OutOfSight-1.12
A 1.12 port of Out Of Sight
Minecraft Forge Mod - Helps improve frame rates by limiting how far away tile entities and entities can render, with configurable ranges.

### Why 1.12?
Even though it's considered bad practice to use outdated software (Minecraft 1.12), a lot of mod authors that have developed 1.12 mods
do not intend to upgrade their mods to later versions of Minecraft, leaving their mods in 1.12 limbo. I've ported this mod to 1.12 so that
large modpacks can gain an extra bit of performance. 

### Credits
